# collatz-tree
Python class to examine lists of numbers generated by the Collatz conjecture algorithm.

A data-structure and collection of methods to examine lists of numbers generated
by the Collatz conjecture algorithm.

A tree of numbers is stored such that the parents are the previous and
children are the next terms in the sequence.  Children and parents are 
not guaranteed to be in numerical order.  Terms are calulated as follows:
    0) If a_n is 1, stop.
    1) If a_n is even, then a_(n+1) = (a_n)/2
    2) If a_n is odd, then a_(n+1) = 3(a_n) + 1

The Collatz conjecture states that all sequences will eventually lead to 1.

Public methods:
    add -- add n and its sequence to 1 to the tree
    fill -- add all numbers up to n and their paths to 1 to the tree
    fill_path -- store the path from n to 1
    fill_all_paths -- stores all paths from numbers in the tree to 1
    get_path -- returns the list of numbers in the path from n to 1
    get_longest_path -- returns longest path to 1 for numbers in the tree
    get_steps_to_one -- returns the length of the path from n to 1

    save_list -- save the current tree and path structure to file (pickle)
    load_list -- load a tree and path structure from file (pickle)

Static methods:
    collatz_sequence -- generate the Collatz sequence from n to 1; return list

Instance variables:
    collatz_tree -- dict; each pair represents {parent: child}
    paths -- dict; each pair represents {number: path}, where path is a list
    verbose -- turns on debugging information printed to console
